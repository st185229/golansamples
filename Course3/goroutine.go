/*
 The routine 1 and 2 execute due to a delay in the main. But dont finish - So does not execute

 The main start with 2 routines , but they dont finish and they run with different speed due to

/*The explanation of the race condition and how it can occur is complete, detailed, and clearly written.
The demo shows the race condition when two  operations are making progress at the same time. Concurrent operations are non-deterministic and are therefore unpredictable and extremely hard to reason about. The routine 1 and routine 2 are kick started from the main thread at the same time one soon after another and followed by a sleep in the main thread so that the routine threads can progress.  The routine 1 (fasterRoutine()) has been made a faster one by introducing small latency (sleep 20 ms) and routine 2 (slowerRoutine()) with bigger latency (40 ms) and executed 1000 times.  They get executed but donâ€™t get completed while main thread wait for a short duration . Both of the routines do not return
The race condition becomes apparent when load is applied (delay). The test below applies 1000 requests using 2 goroutines. The expectation is that the counter is incremented for each loop up to 1000 but the results are way way off:
A global variable (shared variable)  routineCounter is an instance of  RoutineExecutions struct is the variable undergoes race condition.  The RoutineExecutions defined with 3 pointer receivers. The first one SetFast(fast) set the execution counter for the faster one and SetSlow(sloe) for the slower one. The third one  GetTotalExecutions() returns the sum of executions
The race condition caused both routine executes different times with different count
-------------------------------------------
Executed routine1 , 24th time
 Executed routine2 , 13th time
 Program ends with total execution 37
-------------------------------------------------
Executed routine1 , 25th time
 Executed routine2 , 13th time
 Program ends with total execution 38
Executed routine2 , 12th time
 Executed routine1 , 23th time
 Executed routine1 , 24th time
 Program ends with total execution 36
